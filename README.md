# üó£Ô∏è Gender Voice Recognition using Deep Learning & Machine Learning

This project focuses on **gender classification** based on voice characteristics using various models:
- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**
- **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**

The solution involves preprocessing voice data, building and training deep learning and classical models, and evaluating them using accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC, and more.
